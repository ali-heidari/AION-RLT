## Overview

Aixker-RLT (AIXKER Reinforcement Learning Trainer) is a minimal, modular, and production-ready framework for training and evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) models — designed to be embedded in real systems like load balancers, protocol agents, and distributed services.

It’s part of the **AIXKER ecosystem**, an initiative to bring **AI-native intelligence** into modern infrastructure — but AIXKER-RLT can also be used as a **standalone RL framework** in any project.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Lightweight Core** — Simple modular design with minimal dependencies.
- 🧩 **Customizable Inputs/Outputs** — Accept any number of parameters for flexible training.
- 🔁 **Continuous Learning** — Supports online and on-device adaptation in production.
- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Ready** — Built to scale across multiple agents or nodes.
- 📊 **Logging & Metrics Hooks** — Integrates easily with external metric collectors.
- 🖥️ **CPU & GPU compute** — Pure-Rust `ndarray` backend by default; optional GPU backend via `wgpu` (`backend = "Gpu"`).

---

## Installation

Use it as a Git dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aixker-rlt = { git = "https://github.com/ali-heidari/Aixker-RLT" }
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ali-heidari/Aixker-RLT.git
cd Aixker-RLT
cargo build --release
```

---

## 🧬 Example Usage

```rust
use aixker_rlt::{initialize, node::Node, RunningMode};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    env_logger::init();
    let state = Arc::new(Mutex::new(SyntheticState::new()));
    let cloned_state = Arc::clone(&state);

    // Load configuration once at startup
    initialize(load_config().unwrap());

    Node::start(
        // Feature provider: returns the current state as a feature vector
        move |lowest_state| get_features(&mut cloned_state.lock().unwrap(), lowest_state),
        // Reward function: scores the chosen action
        |x, y| compute_reward_with_success(x, y as u8),
        RunningMode::Training,
        "my-model.json",
    )
    .await;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Running modes

`Node::start` takes a `RunningMode`:

| Mode | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `Training` | Continuous online training |
| `TrainingWithInterval` | Training on a fixed interval (`interval_secs`) |
| `Infer` | Inference only — load a trained model and produce actions |

---

## ⚙️ CPU and GPU usage

### CPU (default — fully supported)

By default, training and inference run on the **CPU** through a pure-Rust
`ndarray` implementation. No special flags or features are needed:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

- The async runtime is Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler, so training workers
  use multiple cores out of the box.
- To limit core usage, set the Tokio worker thread count in your host
  application (e.g. `#[tokio::main(worker_threads = 4)]`).

### GPU (selectable via configuration)

A GPU compute backend based on **`wgpu`** (Vulkan / Metal / DX12 / OpenGL)
runs the full pipeline — forward pass, softmax, REINFORCE gradients, and
weight updates — as compute shaders. It works on any GPU supported by `wgpu`
(NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon) without CUDA.

Select it with the `backend` field of `Configurations` (TOML or struct):

```toml
backend = "Gpu"   # default: "Cpu" — the field is optional
```

Behavior:

- **CPU is always the default**; omitting `backend` keeps existing configs
  working unchanged.
- If no compatible GPU adapter is found at startup, the library logs a
  warning and **falls back to CPU automatically** — it never crashes.
- Model checkpoints stay backend-agnostic JSON: after each GPU training
  batch the updated weights are synced back to the CPU copy, so you can
  train on GPU and infer on CPU (or vice versa) with the same file.

The compute shaders live in `src/*.wgsl` (`forward`, `softmax`, `reinforce`,
`grad-weights`, `grad-bias`, `grad-hidden`, `weight-update`), orchestrated by
`src/models/gpu_model.rs`. GPU/CPU parity is covered by the
`gpu_matches_cpu` unit test (`cargo test gpu_matches_cpu`).

> Note: for very small networks (e.g. 8×16×3) CPU is usually faster — GPU
> dispatch overhead dominates. The GPU backend pays off as `hidden_layers`,
> `input_number`, and `batch_size` grow.

---

## Configuration

Configuration is provided at startup via `initialize(...)` with a `Configurations` struct (deserializable with `serde`):

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `input_number` | Number of input features |
| `output_number` | Number of possible actions |
| `hidden_layers` | Hidden layer size |
| `batch_size` / `total_batches` | Training batch settings |
| `reply_capacity` | Replay buffer capacity |
| `interval_secs` | Interval for `TrainingWithInterval` mode |
| `model_name` | Checkpoint file name |
| `log_interval` | Metric logging interval |
| `mode` | `RunningMode` (`Training`, `TrainingWithInterval`, `Infer`) |
| `backend` | Optional `ComputeBackend` (`Cpu` default, `Gpu`) |

- **Inputs:** Any numeric parameters representing the system/environment state
- **Outputs:** Actions or decisions produced by the RL model
- **Logging:** Supports integration with external metric collectors (Falcon Metrics, Prometheus, etc.)
