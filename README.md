## Overview

Aixker-RLT (AIXKER Reinforcement Learning Trainer) is a minimal, modular, and production-ready framework for training and evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) models — designed to be embedded in real systems like load balancers, protocol agents, and distributed services.

It’s part of the **AIXKER ecosystem**, an initiative to bring **AI-native intelligence** into modern infrastructure — but AIXKER-RLT can also be used as a **standalone RL framework** in any project.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Lightweight Core** — Simple modular design with minimal dependencies.
- 🧩 **Customizable Inputs/Outputs** — Accept any number of parameters for flexible training.
- 🔁 **Continuous Learning** — Supports online and on-device adaptation in production.
- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Ready** — Built to scale across multiple agents or nodes.
- 📊 **Logging & Metrics Hooks** — Integrates easily with external metric collectors.
- 🖥️ **CPU-first compute** — Pure-Rust `ndarray` backend; GPU backend (via `wgpu`) in development.

## Installation

Use it as a Git dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
aixker-rlt = { git = "https://github.com/ali-heidari/Aixker-RLT" }
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ali-heidari/Aixker-RLT.git
cd Aixker-RLT
cargo build --release
```

---

## 🧬 Example Usage

```rust
use aixker_rlt::{initialize, node::Node, RunningMode};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    env_logger::init();
    let state = Arc::new(Mutex::new(SyntheticState::new()));
    let cloned_state = Arc::clone(&state);

    // Load configuration once at startup
    initialize(load_config().unwrap());

    Node::start(
        // Feature provider: returns the current state as a feature vector
        move |lowest_state| get_features(&mut cloned_state.lock().unwrap(), lowest_state),
        // Reward function: scores the chosen action
        |x, y| compute_reward_with_success(x, y as u8),
        RunningMode::Training,
    )
    .await;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Running modes

`Node::start` takes a `RunningMode`:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Training` | Continuous online training |
| `TrainingWithInterval` | Training on a fixed interval (`interval_secs`) |
| `Infer` | Inference only — load a trained model and produce actions |

---

## ⚙️ CPU and GPU usage

### CPU (default — fully supported)

All training and inference currently run on the **CPU** through a pure-Rust
`ndarray` implementation. No special flags or features are needed:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

- The async runtime is Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler, so training workers
  use multiple cores out of the box.
- To limit core usage, set the Tokio worker thread count in your host
  application (e.g. `#[tokio::main(worker_threads = 4)]`).

### GPU (experimental — in development)

A GPU compute backend based on **`wgpu`** (Vulkan / Metal / DX12 / OpenGL) is
under active development. The repository already contains the WGSL compute
shaders for the pipeline:

- `src/forward.wgsl` — forward pass
- `src/softmax.wgsl` — action probabilities
- `src/reinforce.wgsl` — REINFORCE gradient step
- `src/weight-update.wgsl` — weight updates

The GPU model (`src/models/gpu-model.rs`) is not yet wired into the public
API, so **GPU execution is not functional yet** — today every build runs on
CPU regardless of available hardware. Once complete, the backend will be
selectable at runtime and will work on any GPU supported by `wgpu` (NVIDIA,
AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon) without CUDA.

## Configuration

Configuration is provided at startup via `initialize(...)` with a `Configurations` struct (deserializable with `serde`):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `input_number` | Number of input features |
| `output_number` | Number of possible actions |
| `hidden_layers` | Hidden layer size |
| `batch_size` / `total_batches` | Training batch settings |
| `reply_capacity` | Replay buffer capacity |
| `interval_secs` | Interval for `TrainingWithInterval` mode |
| `model_name` | Checkpoint file name |
| `log_interval` | Metric logging interval |
| `mode` | `RunningMode` (`Training`, `TrainingWithInterval`, `Infer`) |

* **Inputs:** Any numeric parameters representing the system/environment state
* **Outputs:** Actions or decisions produced by the RL model
* **Logging:** Supports integration with external metric collectors (Falcon Metrics, Prometheus, etc.)
