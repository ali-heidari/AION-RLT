# AION-RLT Architecture

AION-RLT is a lightweight reinforcement learning trainer designed for embeddable applications — adaptive load balancers, protocol agents, trading bots, or any system that maps numeric features to discrete actions. It is a reusable RL engine, not specific to any domain.

## Design philosophy

- **Minimal & modular** — single responsibility per component
- **Configurable** — input/output dimensions, batch size, hyperparameters all tunable
- **Embeddable** — no opinions on what the application does; just trains & infers
- **Async-ready** — Tokio integration for background training loops

## Core modules

- `src/lib.rs` — library entrypoint, `CONFIG` singleton, `initialize()`
- `src/node.rs` — main orchestrator, model lifecycle, and training state
- `src/model.rs` — neural network implementation and policy gradient updates
- `src/worker.rs` — async training loop and batch processing
- `src/reply_buffer.rs` — experience replay buffer
- `src/infer_action.rs` — inference and action selection logic
- `src/experience.rs` — `Experience` struct definition
- `src/configurations.rs` — `Configurations` struct and config loading
- `src/footstep/` — internal diagnostics module
- `src/models/gpu-model.rs`, `src/*.wgsl` — experimental GPU backend (not yet active)

## Node (`node.rs`)

Central orchestrator managing the RL lifecycle for a single agent.

- Holds `Model` (network weights) and `ReplayBuffer` (experience storage)
- Manages `epsilon` (exploration) and `temperature` (softmax control)
- Tracks training metrics: `batch_history`, `success_rate_mean`, divergence/stuck flags
- Supports `RunningMode`: `Infer`, `Training`, `TrainingWithInterval`

Entrypoint:

```rust
Node::start(
    input_bearer,                  // Fn(u32) -> Vec<f32>
    compute_reward_with_success,   // Fn(&Vec<f32>, u32, u32) -> (f32, bool)
    mode,                          // RunningMode
    model_name,                    // checkpoint file name
).await;
```

All shared state uses `Arc<RwLock<T>>`: reader threads (inference) don't block each other, the writer thread (training) gets exclusive access when updating.

## Model (`model.rs`)

Two-layer neural network with ReLU hidden activation:

```text
input (f32) → w1 (input_number × hidden_layers) + b1
           → ReLU
           → w2 (hidden_layers × output_number) + b2
           → Softmax (temperature-controlled)
           → action probabilities
```

- **Training algorithm**: REINFORCE policy gradient — ∇J = Σ ∇log(π(a|s)) · R(a)
- **Checkpoints**: model serialized to JSON (`{w1, b1, w2, b2}` via serde)
- Learning rate is held in `Node.lr` (`RwLock<f32>`) and adjustable at runtime

## ReplayBuffer (`reply_buffer.rs`)

Experience storage with uniform random sampling.

- Stores `Experience { features, action, latency_ms, reward, success, timestamp_ms }`
- Samples random batches for training (no prioritization yet)
- Enforces `reply_capacity`: drops oldest entries when full

Separating the buffer decorrelates experience order (learning stability) and decouples training rate from experience generation rate.

## Worker (`worker.rs`)

Async background training loop:

```text
loop {
  sleep(interval)
  if buffer has ≥ batch_size experiences:
    sample batch → reinforce → save checkpoint
    update batch_history, check convergence/divergence
}
```

The worker runs in the background; the application decides when to stop (counter reaches `total_batches`).

## Inference (`infer_action.rs`)

Action selection via softmax + epsilon-greedy:

1. Forward pass: `logits = model.forward(features)`
2. Softmax with temperature: `probs = softmax(logits / temperature)`
3. Epsilon-greedy: with probability ε pick a random action, otherwise the most probable one
4. Returns `(action_idx, logits, probabilities)`

Pure greedy gets stuck in local optima; pure random never exploits learned knowledge. Epsilon balances both, and the Node adjusts it dynamically.

## Configuration (`configurations.rs`)

Provided at startup via `initialize(...)`:

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `interval_secs` (u64) | Worker loop interval for `TrainingWithInterval` |
| `batch_size` (u32) | Experiences per training iteration |
| `total_batches` (usize) | Training termination point |
| `input_number` (usize) | Feature vector dimension |
| `output_number` (usize) | Action space size |
| `hidden_layers` (usize) | Hidden layer neurons |
| `reply_capacity` (usize) | Max replay buffer size |
| `model_name` (String) | Checkpoint file name |
| `log_interval` (u64) | Logging frequency |
| `mode` (RunningMode) | `Training`, `TrainingWithInterval`, or `Infer` |

**Critical contract:** `input_number` must equal the feature vector length and `output_number` must equal the action space size — a mismatch panics at model initialization.

## Common pitfalls

- **Feature dimension mismatch** — `input_number ≠ features.len()` → panic
- **Reward range** — rewards are expected clamped to `[-1.0, 1.0]`
- **Buffer underflow** — training is skipped gracefully until `batch_size` experiences exist
- **Checkpoint conflicts** — multiple agents writing the same `model_name` corrupt the file; use an ID suffix
- **Temperature too low** — nearly deterministic, little exploration
- **Epsilon too high** — mostly random actions, slow learning

## Extending AION-RLT

- **New training algorithms**: modify `Model::reinforce()`, update the loss calculation, document reward expectations
- **Different input/output sizes**: already supported via config — no code changes
- **Custom metrics**: read `batch_history` / `success_rate_mean` through the `RwLock`s and export to your collector
- **GPU backend**: WGSL shaders (`forward`, `softmax`, `reinforce`, `weight-update`) and a `GpuModel` stub exist but are not yet wired into `lib.rs` — CPU (`ndarray`) is the only functional backend today

## Integration contract

**AION-RLT provides:** action probabilities and predictions from features (`Vec<f32>`); training, model persistence, and the exploration/exploitation tradeoff.

**The application provides:** feature extraction, domain-specific reward calculation, and configuration tuning.
